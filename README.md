This little diddy is a script I wanted to help my Trash Talker app's preferences UI conduct users to the system preferences area for
managing the available speech synth voices.

It took me a while to figure it out since I don't really make use of Apple Script and found the docs counter-untuitive. Nevertheless this thing
seems to work fine, at least on macOS 10.13 with English localizations in-play.
