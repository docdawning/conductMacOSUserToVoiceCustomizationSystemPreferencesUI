This little diddy is a script I wanted to help my Trash Talker app's preferences UI conduct users to the system preferences area for
managing the available speech synth voices.

It took me a while to figure it out since I don't really make use of Apple Script and found the docs counter-untuitive. Nevertheless this thing
seems to work fine, at least on macOS 10.13 with English localizations in-play.

This is a freebie I've hacked-together by googling extensively. I'm bundling it within my TrashTalker app as that was my motivation.

There were various little posts around the web that gave me enough clues to get this going. Here are some of the few helpful ones I still have open
as of when I got this going:
